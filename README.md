# PoC: Determining the Forward Momentum Vector of a Moving Vehicle
After calibrating the device while it is stationary, we establish the following baseline:
z ≈ 9.7 – 9.8 m/s² (gravitational acceleration).

Next, we collect motion data while recording the vehicle's speed, tracking when it accelerates, how long it maintains speed, and when it comes to a stop. We also log braking events to analyze the direction v(x, y) of motion before braking.

A Jupyter Notebook serves as a concise and efficient way to demonstrate this process.

After calibration and using the identified direction vector, the truck's motion can be determined as follows:
